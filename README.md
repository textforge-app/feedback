## What is TextForge?

TextForge is an email approval gateway — AI agents draft emails, humans review and approve them before anything sends. It's the safety layer between your AI and your inbox.

**How it works:**

1. Your AI drafts an email
2. The draft goes to your TextForge approval queue
3. You review, edit, approve, or reject
4. Only approved emails actually send — from your own Gmail account
